# Dotfiles wrapper around Git, using a bare repository
# approach. Run this wrapper just like you would run Git,
# e.g, "dotfiles diff --name-only" instead of "git diff --name-only".
#
# NOTE: The directory ".dotfiles" is used instead of the
#       default Git directory ".git". This means normal
#       Git commands will not work.

git --git-dir="${HOME}/.dotfiles/" --work-tree="${HOME}" "${@}"
